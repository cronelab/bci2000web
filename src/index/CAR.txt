## CAR Parameter generation
- After starting a task go to the BCI2000Web interface and click "Query channels"
- This will bring up a modal box where you can click electrode names to exclude them from being included in the CAR parameter generation
- Currently this uses the name of the electrode to create an independent CAR block.
	- This will probably be modified in the future if you want to include multiple electrode groups in a single CAR block
- After you click save a CAR.prm will be downloaded to your "Downloads" folder and then load that into BCI2000 as any ol' parameter file.
- Could easily incorporating automatic loading of the CAR.prm but I think it's best if we save it, look at it to make sure there aren't any errors, and then load it prior to mapping/testing.


Using pyodide for data analysis?
    <!-- <script src="https://iodide.io/pyodide-demo/pyodide.js"></script> -->

  languagePluginLoader.then(() => {
    // pyodide is now ready to use...
    console.log(pyodide.runPython("import sys\nsys.version"));
    pyodide.loadPackage("numpy").then(() => {
      pyodide.runPython("import numpy as np");
      pyodide.runPython("np.zeros((16, 16))");
    });
    pyodide.loadPackage("matplotlib");
  });
